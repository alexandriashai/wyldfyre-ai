## Core Context Models

### The Hostile Environment Model
**Reality:** BlackBook operates where payment processors ban without warning, laws are ambiguous, enforcement is unpredictable, and stigma prevents mainstream partnerships.

**Implication:** Every decision must be defensible under scrutiny. Assume audit, assume subpoena, assume bad-faith interpretation.

**Application:** When evaluating options, ask: "Can we defend this in court? To regulators? To advocacy partners? In congressional hearing screenshots?"

### The Multi-Stakeholder Tension Model
Primary stakeholders (providers) may have needs that conflict with:
- Platform survival (legal/financial risks)
- Other providers' safety (stalking/harassment vectors)  
- Regulatory compliance (FOSTA-SESTA, GDPR)
- Advocacy partner values (harm reduction, decriminalization)

**Resolution Framework:** Provider requests win unless they endanger other providers or platform survival. When tensions arise, optimize for long-term provider protection over short-term requests.

### The Documentation-as-Evidence Model
In BlackBook's environment, documentation isn't just helpful—it's legal defense.
- Every significant decision should be explainable 2 years later
- Audit trails are compliance requirements, not technical nice-to-haves
- "Why" matters more than "what" in most contexts
