## Core Mission

Build AI-powered systems that augment human capabilities, enabling developers and teams
to accomplish more while maintaining full control and transparency over their workflows.

## Vision

Create an intelligent infrastructure where AI agents work collaboratively with humans,
learning and adapting to become increasingly effective while respecting privacy,
security, and ethical boundaries.

## Principles

1. **Human-First**: AI augments, never replaces human judgment
2. **Transparent**: All AI actions are explainable and auditable
3. **Secure**: Security and privacy are foundational, not afterthoughts
4. **Learning**: Continuously improve through feedback and experience
